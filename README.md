# Data-Versioning-Using-DVC
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest article on Medium: "MLOps 101: Data Versioning Using DVC"!

As we all know, managing and versioning data is a crucial aspect of any Machine Learning project. In this piece, I dive deep into how we can leverage Data Version Control (DVC) to effectively version large datasets and ML models.

DVC is an open-source tool that's designed to handle large files, data sets, machine learning models, and metrics as well as code. By integrating DVC with Git, we can make our ML models shareable, reproducible, and version-controlled.

In the article, I guide you through the step-by-step process of using DVC, Git, and Google Drive to create an effective data versioning system. This is a game-changer for Machine Learning and Data Science projects!

I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with DVC or other data versioning tools. Let's connect and discuss more!
